<h2>About this project</h2>

Furthermore, due to the Covid-19 pandemic to provide more safe, convenient way to the customers this company has decided to introduce online platform for their customers. So that our client required reliable, accurate and efficient computerized system for their furniture store. First we done requirement analysis by having few meetings with our client and understood problems and introduced solutions and additional benefits to our client.
